If you were building a house, you wouldn’t start by making your own hammer, saw and measuring tape, unless, of course, you were a crazy DIY <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgaRd4d8hOY" target="_blank">lumberjack</a>. Instead, you would go to your workshop and pick up your toolbox. The same is true for programming. You <em>could</em> write a program from scratch, and while you would learn a lot, it would take a very long time.</p>
<p>Python ships with a big, invisible workshop. This workshop is called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/" target="_blank">the Standard Library</a> and it’s filled with toolboxes called modules. We used a few of these toolboxes already, such as math and random. Each module is loaded with tools related to a specific task. Carpenters, plumbers, and electricians each have very different tools in their toolboxes. The same is true of modules. Modules are a collection of functions. The math module, for example, is a toolbox filled with math tools.</p>
<h2>Python Modules: Toolboxes for Programming Lumberjacks</h2>
<p>To access a module, we use the import statement. To see what’s available in a module, we use the help() function.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(math)</pre>
<p>This will present you with NAME, DESCRIPTION, and a list of FUNCTIONS. The functions are listed in alphabetical order. Scroll down to the ‘s’ section. See the function sqrt()?</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">sqrt(...)
    sqrt(x)

    Return the square root of x.</pre>
<p>The help file presents you with an example of how to use the function and a short description of what it will do, just like the functions we wrote.</p>
<p>If you scroll down further, you will see under DATA two predefined variables: e and pi. Cool, right? Type ‘q’ to quit and return to the Python prompt.</p>
<p>We access those predefined variables like this:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; math.pi
3.141592653589793</pre>
<p>And we use our math functions like this:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; math.sqrt(169)
13.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.sqrt(170)
13.038404810405298</pre>
<h2>The Dot</h2>
<p>What’s up with that dot? Didn’t we import math? Why do we need to write it out like that?</p>
<p>Importing a module is like placing that toolbox on your workbench. If there’s a specific tool you want to use, you need to tell the interpreter to fetch it from its toolbox. But, if you know which tools you plan to use, you can take them out of the toolbox and put them on the workbench, like this:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; from math import pi, sqrt</pre>
<p>And then you can call those tools, without the math prefix, like this:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">&gt;&gt;&gt; pi
3.141592653589793
&gt;&gt;&gt; sqrt(64)
8.0</pre>
<p>Whether or not you want to be a programmer or a lumberjack, you now know how to import Python modules from the Standard Library. You can now spend your free time to pressing wildflowers.</p>

Doing the same thing over and over again. You know what is fun? Telling a computer to do it for you! That’s when you need a for loop.</p>
<h2>What’s Iteration?</h2>
<p>while loops are useful when you need something to run until a condition is met. Sometimes you know that condition at the start, but you need to repeat a process a certain number of times. Boring.</p>
<p>Did you hear this adage growing up?</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edward_Hickson" target="_blank">If at first you don’t succeed, try, try, try again.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I did and it drove me crazy. But it’s true.</p>
<p>When you are learning a new skill, such as riding a bike or tying your shoe, you probably won’t get it on your first try. So you’ll try again, learning from your earlier experiences. Eventually, after enough attempts, you’ll get it.</p>
<p>That’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration" target="_blank">iteration</a>. You repeat a process until you achieve a desired result.</p>
<h2>How Does a For Loop work?</h2>
<p>Say you’ve got a group of ducks and you want to tag them as geese. In Python, for loops looks like this:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">for duck in flock:
    duck = goose</pre>
<p>We can write that out in plainer language. It helps to read this with a ridiculous British accent (unless you have a ridiculous British accent):</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">for the first duck in the flock:
    make it a goose
for the second duck in the flock:
    make it a goose
for the third duck in the flock:
    make it a goose
...</pre>
<p>And round and round we go until all of the ducks are goosed. In professional terms, each duck is an element and the goosing is the execution of the block. Let’s see this in practice, starting with one of my favorite things, strings.</p>
<h2>For Loops and Strings</h2>
<p>Let’s run a loop over a string.</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">for letter in ‘word’:
    print(letter)</pre>
<p>We can write that out in pseudocode, like this:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">for every letter in the string ‘word’:
    print the letter on a new line</pre>
<p>Looping over a string will even process spaces, because spaces are considered characters:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">for char in ‘for loop’:
    print(char)</pre>
<p>Why did I change the iterator to char? You will often see in code the use of char, or c, in reference to a character in a string. It’s a convention that you should be familiar with.</p>
<p>We can do much more than print each character.</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">for c in ‘byting python’:
    print(c.upper())</pre>
<p>AWESOME!</p>
<h2>Home, Home on the Range… Function</h2>
<p>The range() function let’s you set, well, a range of numbers to process. Like chocolate syrup on vanilla ice cream, it tastes great with for loops. Try this:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">for number in range(10):
    print(number)</pre>
<p>So far, the for loop examples we looked at process small ranges. But for loops are most useful when crunching large collections of elements and big numbers. Do you know the parable of the rice and the chessboard?</p>
<blockquote><p>If a chessboard were to have wheat placed upon each square such that one grain were placed on the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and so on (doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square), how many grains of wheat would be on the chessboard at the finish?</p></blockquote>
<p>In IDLE, create a file called rice.py:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">rice = 1
total = 0

for i in range(1,65):
    total += rice
    print("The amount of rice on square", i, "is: ", rice)
    print(“Out total amount of rice is:”, total)
    rice = rice * 2</pre>
<p>Press F5 or select Run. Hope you’re hungry!</p>

Well, today is your lucky day. You&#8217;re going to program your first Python game.</p>
<h2>Your First Python Game: Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2>
<p>Open IDLE and create a new file, rps.py. Then enter the following:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">from random import randint

#create a list of play options
t = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]

#assign a random play to the computer
computer = t[randint(0,2)]

#set player to False
player = False

while player == False:
#set player to True
    player = input("Rock, Paper, Scissors?")
    if player == computer:
        print("Tie!")
    elif player == "Rock":
        if computer == "Paper":
            print("You lose!", computer, "covers", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "smashes", computer)
    elif player == "Paper":
        if computer == "Scissors":
            print("You lose!", computer, "cut", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "covers", computer)
    elif player == "Scissors":
        if computer == "Rock":
            print("You lose...", computer, "smashes", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "cut", computer)
    else:
        print("That's not a valid play. Check your spelling!")
    #player was set to True, but we want it to be False so the loop continues
    player = False
    computer = t[randint(0,2)]</pre>
<p>Experienced programmers will be very quick to point out that there are better ways to write a “Rock, Paper, Scissors” Python game. But, for a beginner, it’s very important to be able to understand and follow the program. Let’s break it down…</p>
<p>First, we import <span class="lang:python decode:true crayon-inline ">randint</span>  from the <span class="lang:python decode:true crayon-inline ">random</span> module. This is how our computer opponent will play.</p>
<p>Then we create a list of play options:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">#create a list of play options
t = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]</pre>
<p>There are three possible plays you and the computer can make on each turn, “Rock”, “Paper” and “Scissors”.</p>
<p>Next we setup our players, the computer and you:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">#assign a random play to the computer
computer = t[randint(0,2)]

#set player to False
player = False</pre>
<p>We assign a random play to the computer using our list, <i>t, </i>and the randint function. Why (0,2)? Remember that computers start counting at 0. So “Rock” is in the 0 position, “Paper” is in the 1, and so on. Unlike playing RPS with friends in meatspace, the computer has made its play and is waiting for you to take your turn. Also unlike playing RPS with friends in meatspace, the computer isn’t go to cheat and change its play after you make yours. We set you, the player, to False. Why? I’m glad you asked. Let’s take a look at the body of our program the <i>while </i>loop:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">while player == False:
#set player to True
    player = input("Rock, Paper, Scissors?")
    if player == computer:
        print("Tie!")
    elif player == "Rock":
        if computer == "Paper":
            print("You lose!", computer, "covers", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "smashes", computer)
    elif player == "Paper":
        if computer == "Scissors":
            print("You lose!", computer, "cut", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "covers", computer)
    elif player == "Scissors":
        if computer == "Rock":
            print("You lose...", computer, "smashes", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "cut", computer)
    else:
        print("That's not a valid play. Check your spelling!")
    #player was set to True, but we want it to be False so the loop continues
    player = False
    computer = t[randint(0,2)]</pre>
<p>Once the while loop starts, the computer will patiently wait for you to make a play. As soon as you take your turn, your status changes from False to True because any value assigned to the variable player makes player True. We use the input() function to pass the new value to the variable player. Your input will determine which statement is triggered below.</p>
<p>Using nested if/elif/else statements, we check every possible outcome of the game and return a message stating the winner, a tie, or an error.</p>
<p>We use else at the end to catch anything that isn’t “Rock”, “Paper” or “Scissors”. Finally we reset the player value to False to restart the while loop.</p>

But they can also get out of hand. Programming is like a circus: you gotta keep the lions in the ring. Or pythons in the loop. It might seem simple, but Python loop control is very important for creating bug-free interactive programs.</p>
<h2>Infinite Loops</h2>
<p>With great power comes great responsibility. While <i>while</i> loops are incredibly powerful, there’s a pitfall you need to be aware of: the infinite loop.The loop in the following function will repeat endlessly until you force it to quit or the world ends, whichever comes first:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">&gt;&gt;&gt; while True:
…    print(“Are we there yet?”)
…</pre>
<p>Try it.</p>
<p>Annoyed yet? Press Ctrl + C to break out of the loop. Much like a road trip, it’s important to take breaks. The break statement in Python is a means of escape from a loop.</p>
<h2>Python Loop Control Using input(), strip() and break</h2>
<p>I promised interactivity in the previous tutorial and now is your moment of Zen. Create a new file, roadtrip.py, and enter the following:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">while True:
    n = input(“Are we there yet? “)
    if n.strip() == ‘yes’ or ‘Yes’ or ‘YES!’:
        break</pre>
<p>The example above introduces two new built-in functions, input() and strip(). The input() function presents a prompt to the user of a program and patiently waits until anything is entered. We are using the strip() method to clean up any spaces that may be accidentally entered into the console when pounding out ‘YES!’ Try it: add as many spaces as you like before or after ‘yes’. They will be stripped away. Lastly, if the text entered at the prompt matches ‘yes’, ‘Yes’, or ‘YES!’, the <i>break</i> statement is called, and we escape from the incessant while loop.</p>
<p>Fun fun fun! But we’re not there yet. <a href="https://thehelloworldprogram.com/python/python-game-rock-paper-scissors/">Join us in the next tutorial to build on this and write an interactive game, the classic ‘Rock, Paper, Scissors’.</a></p>

I did. I still play it, though it’s hard to find adults willing to join me. If you live outside the United States you probably played a version called Statues. But what does this have to do with Python while loops? Allow me to explain&#8230;</p>
<p>To play Red Light/Green Light, you and your friends gather in an open space. One of you decides to be <i>It</i> and stands at one end of the space while the rest of you line up at the other end. <i>It</i> then turns it’s back to the group, shouting ‘Green light!’ and the group rushes forward, the goal of which is to reach the other side of the open space or touch <i>It</i>. When <i>It</i> turns back around and shouts ‘Red light!’, everyone must stop and if <i>It</i> sees anyone moving, that person must go back to the beginning.</p>
<h2>Python while Loops</h2>
<p>That’s also how while loops work in programming. This is what a Python while loop looks:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">&gt;&gt;&gt; while light == ‘green’:
…    go()
…</pre>
<p>We can think of while loops like repeating if statements:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">&gt;&gt;&gt; if light == ‘green’:
…    go()
&gt;&gt;&gt; if light == ‘green’:
…    go()
&gt;&gt;&gt; if light == ‘green’:
…    go()</pre>
<p>You get the idea&#8230;</p>
<p>While loops are useful when we want to maintain a state until a certain condition is met or until some external event occurs, such as the light suddenly turning red. Then you best FREEZE!</p>
<h2>Python while Loops and Boolean Logic</h2>
<p>If you love playing video games, like I do, and if you’re as bad at games as I am, then you probably see this all the time:</p>
<pre class="">Continue? 10, 9, 8, 7, 6...</pre>
<p>This very simple countdown is a while loop. You can write it like this:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">count = 10
while count &gt; 0:
    print(“Continue? ”, count)
    count-=1</pre>
<p>What’s this <span class="lang:python decode:true crayon-inline ">count-=</span>  business? This is called the decrement operator. It’s most useful in a loop because each time we use it, it subtracts 1 from the value it is operating on. Create a new file, count.py, and run the following program:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">count = 10
while count &gt; 0:
    print(“count before decrement: ”, count)
    count-=1
    print(“count after decrement:”, count)
    print(“count is still greater than zero, so… run the loop again!”)</pre>
<p>When we begin the while loop, count is equal to 10. We then subtract 1, which leaves us with 9. But 9 is still greater than zero, so we take it from the top and run the loop again and again until count is equal to zero.</p>
<p>We can also add to our value in a loop with the increment operator. All we need to do is make a few simple changes to the example above:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">count = 0
while count &lt; 10:
    print(“count before increment: ”, count)
    count+=1
    print(“count after increment:”, count)
    print(“count is still less than ten, so… run the loop again!”)</pre>
<p>Python while loops are a simple means to introduce complexity into your programs. If you choose to Continue, <a href="https://thehelloworldprogram.com/python/python-loop-control/">join us in the next tutorial where we build upon the count example and write an interactive program</a>.</p>

The elif statement is a <i>portmanteau </i>of <i>else</i> and <i>if</i>. A portmanteau is any word that is a mash-up of two other words. We use elif for if statements that have multiple choices. It’s like saying, “If not this, or this, then that.”</p>
<h2>Python elif Statements</h2>
<p>In case you’ve never played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders" target="_blank">Snakes (or Chutes) and Ladders</a>, here’s a quick run-down: You play with a board mapping out twisty snakes (or chutes) and ladders, figurines for the players, and a die or a spinner. You roll the die(or spin the spinner) and move that many squares on the board. If the square your game piece lands on is the bottom of a ladder you get to climb up and skip all of the squares in between the base of the ladder and its top rung. But, if the space on which your game piece lands is the head of a snake, you slide down its body, thus losing ground gained towards reaching the end goal.</p>
<p>Let’s write a simple version of this game in Python. But let’s call it ‘Snakes and Pythons’, because learning Python is like climbing a ladder. Open IDLE and create a new file, snakes_pythons.py. First, we import the random module. We’re going to use it’s function, randint, to generate a roll of the die, or a random integer.</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">from random import randint</pre>
<p>Next we declare the roll of our die. Imagine our die has only three sides. Impossible? Not in programming. This is where we use the randint function to randomly generate 0, 1 or 2. Remember that computers start counting at 0.</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">roll = randint(0, 2)</pre>
<p>Now let’s lay out our board. We’ll keep it simple and only use three squares, <i>neutral, ladder, </i>and <i>snake, </i>and nest them inside our <em>if</em> statement.</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">if roll == 0:
    print(“Python FTW!”)
elif roll == 1:
    print(“Snake bite!”)
else:
    print(“Meh. Think I'll stay here.”)</pre>
<p>We don’t need to test our last condition because anything that is not 0 or 1 will be caught by the <i>else</i> statement. Multiple conditions allow you to sort complex choices. Fun, right?

Dinner always consisted of healthy stuff like spinach so it was very hard to finish. That was my introduction to <strong>conditional statements</strong>. Conditional statements are like saying, “If this, then that.” <i>If </i>I ate dinner, <i>then</i> I got dessert. In my example, eating dinner is the <i>boolean condition </i>and getting dessert is the <i>consequent.</i> if Python, then code?<i> </i></p>
<h2>If Python, then Cake!</h2>
<p>We can write my example above in Python:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; dinner = True
&gt;&gt;&gt; if dinner == True:
…    print('Cake!')
…
Cake!</pre>
<p>Sweet! I ate dinner so I get dessert. Unless the cake is a lie…</p>
<p>We don’t have to explicitly evaluate True or False in our condition statement. Python will interpret the value of our variable and proceed accordingly. I can rewrite the above example like this:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; if dinner:
…    print('Cake!')</pre>
<p>Because the variable dinner was assigned True, I get cake.</p>
<p><b>else</b></p>
<p>Let’s write the function, dessert(), this time with what is called an <i>alternative.</i></p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; def dessert(cake):
…    if cake == False:
...        print('The cake is a lie!')
…    else:
...        print('Om nom nom.')
…</pre>
<p>Piece of cake, right? It gets better. Let’s combine Boolean logic operators with our variables.</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; dinner = False
&gt;&gt;&gt; if not dinner:
…    print('How can you have any pudding, if you don’t eat your meat?')</pre>
<p>If you recall, <span class="lang:python decode:true crayon-inline ">if not dinner</span>  is the same as &#8220;if dinner is False&#8221;.</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; dinner = True
&gt;&gt;&gt; cake = True
&gt;&gt;&gt; if dinner and cake:
…    print('So full!')</pre>
<p>You can only get &#8216;So full!&#8217; if both dinner and cake are True.</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; dinner = False
&gt;&gt;&gt; cake = True
&gt;&gt;&gt;if dinner or cake:
    print('Yay! I choose cake!')</pre>
<p>If you want to test a condition, use an <em>if</em> statement. If you learned nothing, start again. Else, <a href="https://thehelloworldprogram.com/python/python-elif-snakes-else-ladders/">proceed to the next tutorial: multiple conditions</a>.</p>
