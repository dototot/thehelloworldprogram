		<description><![CDATA[hey guys: Thanks for this wonderful resource, the hello world program.
I&#039;m a novice and this is helping me out a lot.
I had a specific question regarding the code on this page &#039;python loop control&#039;.
Q: When I write the code into the IDL or the shell. The execution leads to the display of the text(are we there yet). And the computer waits for my input. But here is the thing, it doesn&#039;t matter what i write(yes, no, random strings) or don&#039;t write, as long as I press enter, the program is done executing. I took out the whole .strip() part but it still does the same . Any suggestions]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great.  Thank you.  That makes sense.  I think you will also want to set the computer&#039;s random answer within the while loop as well.  Otherwise, the computer&#039;s answer always remains the same.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for getting in touch! There was a formatting error in the code which is now corrected above. You need to set the Player to False inside the while loop to keep the game running. You&#039;ll also need to press Ctrl + C to exit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is my first python game, so please forgive what is probably a stupid question.  The game seems to only allow you to play it once. Is it possible to play repeatedly without re-running the module?  My guess is yes, since we go to the trouble of resetting the player to False.  Thanks for the help!]]></description>
